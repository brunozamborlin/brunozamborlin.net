City of Plants – Venice Biennale 2025
Location: Venice
Category: Art/Performances
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRXUSf7r_Ro
Description: An interactive installation by MAD Architects and Bruno Zamborlin that merges natural, human, and artificial intelligence into a single living ecosystem of sound and light. The work integrates real plants with environmental sensors, LED systems, and visitor interaction to create an evolving ambient composition where plant biofeedback, human movement, and algorithmic processes are translated into synchronized sound and visual responses. The installation proposes a shared intelligence system where plants, humans, and AI linked through a common language of vibrations, data, and perception create a co-creative environment. Visitor footsteps trigger musical tones that harmonize with plant-generated drones, making human presence part of an integrated ecological soundscape rather than an external disruption.

Audi City Lab
Location: Milan
Category: Installations
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBy6V-RTN-E
Description: Spaces as living entities. An artistic installation in Milan's Piazza del Quadrilatero featuring water flooding the space and transforming it into a liquid mirror. The installation uses innovative sensors by Bruno Zamborlin to capture human movement and translate it into sound waves, creating an interactive musical experience where visitors become part of the artwork. Every step, every movement on the walkway becomes an artistic expression creating an immersive and collective experience that blurs the line between spectator and artwork. Features include water flooding creating reflective surfaces, interactive sensor technology responding to movement and touch, sound generation synchronized with visitor interaction, ring of light that pulses with movement, four cars on display functioning as instruments, reflections on water synchronized with activity. Collaboration with MAD architects.

TECHNOLOGY

YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X9k73HHMyw

By coupling vibration sensors with specialized algorithms, inanimate objects, surfaces, and entire spaces can be enabled to respond to human touch and atmospheric phenomena in real-time.

The natural acoustics of solid surfaces can be altered so as to produce musical sounds which are always unique, as is every lightest touch, gentle caress, or falling raindrop.

These algorithms can also control lighting and video displays, creating synesthetic experiences of touch, sound and light.

Such data-enabled surfaces open up new possibilities for understanding and engaging with the spaces around us.


ABOUT

About

Bruno Zamborlin, PhD, is an AI researcher and artist, recognized for revolutionizing human-computer interaction through his startups: Mogees, HyperSurfaces, and HyperSentience. His work focuses on transforming everyday objects and surfaces into interactive, intelligent entities, thereby redefining our interaction with the space and between us. Based in London and Milan, Bruno Zamborlin is a four times TEDx speaker and honorary research fellow at Goldsmiths, univ. Of London. His artworks have been showcased at venues like the Venice Biennale and the London Victoria & Albert Museum.

Art Practice

At the core of Zamborlin's work is a keen desire to create connections—whether between friends, strangers, or the spaces that envelop them. By transforming everyday objects and surfaces into interactive canvases, Zamborlin invites participants into a shared experience, turning mundane moments into opportunities for discovery and connection, fostering a sense of community and shared wonder.

Zamborlin's work gives voice to the world around us. Through his pioneering application of vibration sensors and algorithms, spaces and objects gain the ability to respond to human touch, movement, and even atmospheric changes, effectively speaking to us in a language of light, sound and data. This interaction blurs the lines between the animate and inanimate, inviting observers to reconsider their relationship with their surroundings.

In a society increasingly mediated by touchscreens and virtual interfaces, Zamborlin's work is a reminder of the richness of the physical world. By emphasizing tactile engagement and the sensory experiences of the environment and people around us, he offers a counter-narrative to the digital disconnection, rekindling an appreciation for the tangible and fostering a deeper, more meaningful interaction with the world.
